# How AI Supercharged My Workflow:
**Rebuilding My Dev Environment with ChatGPT as a True Partner**

> *“Imagine having a senior engineer at your side, helping you turn your dotfiles, your habits, and your daily tools into a finely tuned productivity machine.”*

Today, you don’t have to imagine.
With AI tools like ChatGPT, you can bring your development environment to the next level—**no matter what you use**.

## Bigger Than Just Vim and Zsh

This article tells my story of revamping a Vim and Zsh setup, but it’s about much more than plugins and themes.

**If you have your own set of dotfiles, aliases, or favorite tools—AI can help you**:

- Spot slowdowns or redundancies
- Discover new tools and workflows
- Clean up legacy configs
- Document everything, step by step
- Make your environment portable, reproducible, and *fun* to use

All you need to do is **describe your ideal setup (or upload your dotfiles)** and start a conversation. The AI becomes your technical editor, teacher, and creative pair programmer.

## My Collaboration with AI

I started by sharing my `.vimrc` and `.zshrc`—the heart of my workflow—with ChatGPT.

#### Warning: Be careful NOT upload any environment variables

But instead of just asking for quick tips, I said:
> "Let's truly modernize this. What would you recommend if you could see everything I use?"

What followed wasn’t a one-way stream of advice, but a **back-and-forth collaboration**:
- ChatGPT reviewed and suggested plugin swaps and workflow upgrades
- We fixed obscure errors together (hello, mysterious `~/.z` bug!)
- It recommended visual improvements, performance tweaks, and new commands
- It wrote full documentation—changelogs, setup scripts, and a README—alongside me
- It even summarized entire journey and wrote this article.

## The Process, Step by Step

1. **Audit:** AI read through my existing configs and explained what each part did.
2. **Recommend:** It suggested faster plugin managers, like `vim-plug` for Vim and `Powerlevel10k` for Zsh.
3. **Upgrade:** Together, we reorganized, replaced, and cleaned up years of bloat.
4. **Document:** AI structured everything with clear changelogs, install guides, and even this article.
5. **Repeat:** We discussed questions and issues in real time, iterating like a real team.

The tools were Vim and Zsh for me—but the method works for **any environment, any stack**.

## Why This Is Game-Changing

- **Personalization:** AI recommendations are tailored to *your* stack, your language, your workflow.
- **Clarity:** Explanations are clear, not just code dumps. I learned *why* to use each tool.
- **Speed:** I had a completely upgraded environment, with documentation, in under a day.
- **Empowerment:** I’m no longer afraid to try new tools or restructure configs.
- **Portability:** My setup is now easy to install anywhere—just clone, run a script, and go.

## Technical Highlights (for the Curious)

- **Switched Vim from Vundle to `vim-plug` for speed**
- **Rebuilt Zsh config with `Powerlevel10k` and autosuggestions**
- Added modern plugins: `fzf`, `gitgutter`, `vim-airline`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, and more
- Wrote custom aliases and quick-access commands
- Added persistent undo, better search, and tab settings in Vim
- Fixed edge-case errors and cleaned up old config cruft
- **All changes documented:**
  - [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jono-booth/pro-dotfiles/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - [README.md](https://github.com/jono-booth/pro-dotfiles/blob/main/README.md)
  - [setup.sh](https://github.com/jono-booth/pro-dotfiles/blob/main/setup.sh)

## The Result

- Terminal and editor are now *lightning fast*
- Prompt is minimal, smart, and beautiful
- Git, file navigation, linting, and editing just *work*
- My whole setup is portable to any new machine with a one-liner

## Try This Yourself

You don’t need to use Vim and Zsh.
Just upload your dotfiles (Bash, Fish, Emacs, VSCode settings—anything) to ChatGPT or your AI of choice.
Ask:
> “Can you help me make this faster, more maintainable, and more productive?”

Be ready for real, actionable advice and collaborative iteration.

If you want to see my setup, clone it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jono-booth/pro-dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Or just use the inspiration to overhaul your own.

## Final Thoughts

This wasn’t about flexing with dotfiles.
It was about **using AI as a co-pilot for your developer experience**—helping you discover, document, and refine the tools you use every day.

Don’t just ask ChatGPT to fix bugs.
Ask it to make your whole workflow *better*—and have fun learning and collaborating along the way.
